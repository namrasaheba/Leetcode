# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
First intuition is the brute-force approach where we could simply create a new matrix with the intended rows and columns with all 0s. However, I quickly realized that to make any row 0 you simply need to initiate the row again with an empty array and by default it will be initiated with all 0s. For columns, we keep a track of all the column identifiers that are having 0 and then iterate over them again to make them 0.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
As explained in intuition and code below.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(m*n)$$ - since we iterate over the matrix twice.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$ - we are storing all the columns that have 0.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {

        // Store the columns that have 0
        List<Integer> cols = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate over the rows
        for (int m = 0; m < matrix.length; m++) {
            // Boolean to check ff the row contains zero
            boolean rowContainsZero = false;

            // Iterate over the cols
            for (int n = 0; n < matrix[0].length; n++) {
                // If there is any number that is 0
                if (matrix[m][n] == 0) {
                    // Make the boolean true
                    rowContainsZero = true;
                    // Add the column id in the list
                    cols.add(n);
                }                    
            }
            // Since this row has been iterated, we can now safely make the entire row 0
            // by checking the boolean
            if (rowContainsZero)
                matrix[m] = new int[matrix[0].length];
        }

        // For all the columns, that have 0 in them, just make them 0
        for (int i = 0; i < cols.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix.length; j++) {
                matrix[j][cols.get(i)] = 0;
            }
        }    
    }
}
```
