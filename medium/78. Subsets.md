# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This problem seemed like a "Backtracking problem" at start but then later figured that it can be done much more simply then the backtracking way.

The idea is to simply create subsets by adding each number to the already existing subsets and then continue iteration until we reach the end of input array.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Explained well in the code.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(N×2^N)$$ - to generate all subsets and then copy them into output list.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(N×2^N)$$ - This is exactly the number of solutions for subsets
multiplied by the number $$N$$ of elements to keep for each subset.

For a given number, it could be present or absent (i.e. binary choice) in a subset solution.

As as result, for $$N$$ numbers, we would have in total $$2^N$$ choices (solutions).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> powerSet = new ArrayList<>();
        powerSet.add(new ArrayList<>());
        
        // Iterate over each input number
        for (int number : nums) {        
            // A temp list that will store the new subsets created by adding the current number to all the existing subsets.    
            List<List<Integer>> newSubs = new ArrayList<>();
            // Iterate over all the existing subsets.
            for (List<Integer> curr : powerSet) {            
                // Create a new subset and Add the current number to it.
                List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>(curr);
                subset.add(number);
                // Add the new subset to the temp list.
                newSubs.add(subset);                
            }

            // Add all the new subsets to the power-set
            for (List<Integer> subset : newSubs) {
                powerSet.add(subset);
            }
        }    
        return powerSet;
    }
}
```
