# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Since, the problem is about printing elements in the spiral order, it immediately comes to mind that we need to keep printing and then keep altering our boundary conditions to print in the order that we want to print.

We can have four boundary conditions - left, right, top, bottom - that will act as our boundaries when printing elements.

We print in the following order,
1. First we print the entire top row, and then shrink the top boundary by 1
2. Second we print the entire right column, and then shrink the top boundary by 1
3. Third we print the entire bottom row, and then shrink the bottom boundary by 1
4. Fourth we print the entire left column, and then shring the left boundary by 1

While printing the bottom row and thee left column, we need to ensure that we are taking care of the two edge cases:
1. While printing the bottom row, we need to ensure that the top boundary is smaller or equal to the bottom boundary [this edge case will happen whenever there is one row matrix]
2. While printing the left row, we need to ensure that the left boundary is smaller or equal to the right boundary [this edge case will happend whenever this is one column matrix]

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Explained above, and in the code.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(m *n)$$ - where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is because we iterate over the matrix exactly once.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ - we do not use any extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> spiralOrder(int[][] matrix) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int top = 0, bottom = matrix.length - 1;
        int left = 0, right = matrix[0].length - 1;

        while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
            // print every number in top row
            for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                result.add(matrix[top][i]);
            }
            // since we have printed all elements of top row,
            // we can shrink the top boundary by 1.
            top++;

            // print every number in right col
            for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
                result.add(matrix[i][right]);
            }
            // since we have printed all elements of right col,
            // we can shrink the right boundary by 1.
            right--;

            // for edge cases where there is only one row in the matrix
            if ( top <= bottom) {
                // print every number in bottom row
                for (int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                    result.add(matrix[bottom][i]);
                }
                // since we have printed all elements of bottom row,
                // we can shrink the bottom boundary by 1.
                bottom--;
            }

            // for edge cases where there is only one long column in matrix
            if ( left <= right) {
                // print every number in left col
                for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                    result.add(matrix[i][left]);
                }
                // since we have printed all elements of left col,
                // we can shrink the left boundary by 1.
                left++;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
