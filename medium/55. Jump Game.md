# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I was not able to come up with an optimal solution for this by myself, hence I looked up the solution on YouTube.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Explained in the YT video and also in comments.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$ - since we iterate over the input array once.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ - since we don't use any extra space.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {

        // we start iterating from backwards
        // and keep shifting our goal post as soon as the current goal-post is reachable.
        int goal = nums.length - 1;

        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {            

            // when we know that the current goal-post is reachable from the current index i
            // we move our goal post to the current index i.
            // This way we keep moving towards the start of the array
            // and finally we should be able to reach a point where the goal becomes our first index.
            if ((i + nums[i]) >= goal) {
                goal = i;
            } 
        }

        // by the end of the iteration, we know that if the goal is 0 then the final index is reachable
        // otherwise we cannot reach the end.
        return goal == 0 ? true : false;
    }
}
```
