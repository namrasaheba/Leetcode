# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The intuition was the 2-pass solution:
1. Count the total red and white balls. (Blue balls are the remaining balls)
2. Fill the array sequentially with red -> white -> blue balls.

--------

Optimized 1-pass approach is the Dutch-National Flag problem.
The idea is to maintain 3 pointers, low, mid and high. 
1. When the number is 0, you swap the number at mid-point with low pointer.
2. When the number is 1, you simply keep the number as-is and increment the mid-pointer.
3. When the number is 2, you swap the number at mid-point with high pointer.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
As explained above, and in the code comments below.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$ - for both the approaches - intuitive and optimized.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$ - for intuitive approach
$$O(1)$$ - for the optimized approach

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    // Intuitive 2-pass solution
    // We first count total red and white balls.
    // public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
    //     int r = 0, w = 0;
    //     for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    //         if (nums[i] == 0)
    //             r++;
    //         else if (nums[i] == 1)
    //             w++;
    //     }

    // We start filling the array with red balls
    //     for (int i = 0; i < r; i++)
    //         nums[i] = 0;
        
    // Then we start filling the array with white balls
    //     for (int i = r; i < r+w; i++)
    //         nums[i] = 1;

    // Then we fill the remaining array with blue balls
    //     for (int i = r+w; i < nums.length; i++)
    //         nums[i] = 2;
    // }

    // The Dutch-National Flag algo
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                // Swap the number at low index with mid index
                swap (nums, low, mid);
                // Increment low and mid pointer
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                // If the number is 1 then no swapping, simply increment the mid pointer
                mid++;
            } else {
                // Swap the number at high index with mid index
                swap (nums, high, mid);
                // Decrement high pointer
                high--; 
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int [] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```
