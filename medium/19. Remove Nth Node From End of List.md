# Problem
19. Remove Nth Node From End of List https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Since this needed removing nth node from end, it clearly meant that we needed to maintain some sort of additional counter/pointer that would point to the node that needs to be deleted when we reach the end. 

Since, brute force approach needed two iterations, I tried optimizing it with an approach that only had single iteration.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We create two additional nodes - one for the pointer that will keep track of which node's next node should be deleted and the other one will point to the final answer.

The approach is simple - we initially iterate the list until n nodes and then we start incrementing the pointer node for every node we iterate in the main list. This way when we reach the end of the list, our pointer node will be pointing to the node whose next node needs to be deleted.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n) - n is the length of the list.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(1) - we maintain two additional pointers.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        int i = 1;
        ListNode curr = head;
        // This variable will act as the pointer that will point to the node whose next node needs to be deleted.
        ListNode pointer = head;
        // We need a node that will point to the head of our final list.
        ListNode answer = pointer;
        while (i <= n) {
            curr = curr.next;
            i++;
        }

        if (curr == null) {
            // It means n was equal to the length of the list
            // so we simply return head.next as the answer.
            return head.next;
        }

        // We keep iterating until the end of the list
        // so that by the end of the iteration,
        // the 'pointer' will be pointing to the node
        // whose next node is to be deleted.
        while (curr.next != null) {
            curr = curr.next;
            pointer = pointer.next;                            
        }
        
        // Since the next pointer is to be deleted,
        // we simply point the 'pointer' node's next pointer to the node after it.
        pointer.next = pointer.next != null ? pointer.next.next : null;

        return answer;
    }
}
```
