# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Honestly, I didn't have any intuition but looked at some of the discussions to understand that first we need to transpose the matrix and then we need to flip the columns. See this to visually understand better: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/comments/1574669

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Approach is simple:
1. First we transpose the matrix
2. We flip the columns from center, keeping rows as-is.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
$$O(n^2)$$ - Since, we iterate over the entire matrix with for loops.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ - Since, we do not use any extra space other than a 'temp' constant.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        // First we transpose the matrix.
        for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
            for (int col = row; col < matrix[row].length; col++) {
                int temp = matrix[row][col];
                matrix[row][col] = matrix[col][row];
                matrix[col][row] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Then we flip the columns from center
        for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
            int centerCol = matrix.length / 2;
            for (int col = 0; col < centerCol; col++) {
                int temp = matrix[row][col];
                int swapCol = matrix.length - col - 1;
                matrix[row][col] = matrix[row][swapCol];
                matrix[row][swapCol] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
