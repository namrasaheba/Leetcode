# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I wasn't able to come up with an optimal solution for this one, hence I looked up the solution on YouTube.

Refer both the links but the Greedy approach explained in the "Algorithms made easy" is slightly better to understand.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Explained in the YT video and also in the code comments below.

# Complexity
## Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$ - we iterate over the input array once.

## Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$ - no extra space used for the solution

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        // result variable
        int jumps = 0;

        // farthest will store the farthest index we can jump from any of the indexes
        // in the current window.
        //
        // end will store the last index of the current window
        int farthest = 0, end = 0;

        // we run the loop until the second last index
        // otherwise for edge cases where the last jump lands on the final index
        // we will increment the jump while iterating on last index.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);

            // when we reach to the end of the current window
            // 3 things will happen
            // 1. We will hvae found the farthest index we can jump from the current window
            // 2. we need to take a jump and
            // 3. move to the next window (hence update the end of the window to the current farthest)
            if (i == end) {
                end = farthest;
                jumps++;
            }
        }

        return jumps;
    }
}
```
